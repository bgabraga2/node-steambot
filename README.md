# Node SteamBot
SteamBot - Node.js


I developed this bot in late 2017 for a site that I had where I was selling Counter-Strike skins and needed to distribute them to clients automatically.

t the time there was already another bot in C #, but I found Node.js more interesting, and I decided to develop.

This bot makes transactions between a site and Steam, transferring skins from games like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress
